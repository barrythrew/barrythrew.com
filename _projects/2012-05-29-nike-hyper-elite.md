To pay tribute to players whose game has reached elite status, Nike developed the Nike Hyper Elite Platinum uniform. Designed with both sustainability and performance in mind, the uniform debuted at a multi-dimensional performance event created to celebrate the sport and its top talent.

The live show transported players through 8 fantasy worlds, each inspired by a leading NCAA basketball team, and all created within the context of an interactive 3D basketball court. The experiences were activated by the players, who were chosen from the best New York City streetballers.

A combination of live projection mapping, 3D animation, and live basketball for a live audience made the experience an unmatched sensory event—or in the words of one writer, “basketball performance art.” Players interacted with each other and their virtual worlds, making the trajectory of the narrative totally dynamic.
