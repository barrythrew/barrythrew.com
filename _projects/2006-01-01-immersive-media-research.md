Immersive Media Research is dedicated to providing sound designers, musicians, and composers with professional, and powerful software products that address the entire production chain associated with the development of multichannel audio
content.

As a programmer at IMR I have been involved with the devel- opment of a number of tools allowing users to build complex surround mixes using spatial motion paths, and incorporating features never before seen in commercial mixing applications; such as algorithmic mixing (chaotic, non-linear, flocking, etc.) and real-time control via an assortment of USB and MIDI controllers.
