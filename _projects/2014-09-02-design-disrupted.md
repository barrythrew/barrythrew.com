New York City's Pier 36 was transformed into a multi-faceted installation space, where celebrated British fashion designer Gareth Pugh unveiled his Spring / Summer 2015 collection.

Combining the forces of fashion, music, animation, projection, choreography and told through the powerful performance of Coco Rocha, Design Disrupted was an abstract narrative around the dichotomy of light and dark, good and evil. The stage boasted a 40’ x 20’ holographic plane, 3x projection mapped background walls and a carefully choreographed dance. Various filmed elements combined with original animations for the piece.
