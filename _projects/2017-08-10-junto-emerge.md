The Disquiet Junto is a group in which musicians respond to weekly, fast-turnaround assignments to compose, record, and share new music. The idea is to use constraints as a springboard for creativity.

This edition was a collaboration organized around #NEWPALMYRA. VR Artist Page Dansinger created Virtual Reality renditions 3D models inspired by the architecture and cultural heritage of Palmyra, Syria for the Oculus with Tilt Brush. 

It resulted in 30 Sound Artists creating music for this compilation.
