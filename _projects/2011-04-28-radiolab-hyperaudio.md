The RadioLab episode Desperately Seeking Symmetry has been turned into an experimental hyper audio player - linking images, comments, and an animated transcript to the audio, using a HTML5 web framework called Hyperaudio. 

Hyperaudio links text to specific moments in a piece of video or audio. We make online video as easy to consume, share, and remix as text. The backbone for this is time-coded transcriptions: lists of words that were spoken in a video, where we know the exact moment that each word was said.
