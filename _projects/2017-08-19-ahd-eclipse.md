In the midst of an eclipse, what we take for granted is called into question. Just as the darkness elicits wonder and fear, perhaps it also sparks inspiration. 

Our world has been shadowed by the specter of crisis: political regression and entrenchment, the unrelenting weight of systemic oppression and inequality, unchecked climate change, the unknown consequences of globally deployed artificial intelligence, the ruptured boundaries of global capitalism; what agency do artists have to respond effectively? What roles does artistic inquiry play in illuminating the path to a more sustainable, just, and equitable future? 

To suggest alternatives, Art Hack Day, the global non-profit dedicated to the expressive potential of new technology, the power of radical collaboration in art, and their combined ability to affect social change for public good, turns its focus to St. Louis, Missouri for a special event showcasing hackers whose medium is art and artists whose medium is tech. The event brings creative practitioners to the Cortex district of St. Louis from Aug 18th - 21st to develop and present an exhibition of new works responding to some of the most pressing issues unique to the area, and around the globe, today.
