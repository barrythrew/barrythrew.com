Westfield’s iconic dome will come to life each night with this one-of-a-kind animated 3D light spectacular that promises to capture the imagination of young and old. _Illuminique Under the Dome _is a magical story set in a 19th Century toymaker’s workshop. Old meets new, as the Centre’s elegant 1908 glass dome is transformed into a state-of-the-art surround theater exhibiting the latest in projection mapping technology.

A lively cast of holiday characters including sugar plum fairies, toy soldiers, and gingerbread men are brought to life under the Dome. They twirl, drum, and dance in unison creating festive melodies that contribute to a dynamic mechanical orchestra. The 4-minute show crescendos as more toys join the brigade and the entirety of the 102-foot dome becomes one gigantic holiday music machine. The production is an unrivaled “must-see” experience for Bay Area locals and visitors from around the world.
