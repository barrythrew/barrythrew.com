The **K-Bow**, by [Keith McMillen Instruments](http://www.keithmcmillen.com), is the worlds first stage-worthy wireless sensor bow for string instruments. The bows capture gestures from real-time performance, and transmit the data via a Bluetooth connect to a computer where it can be used to process sound, control an electronic composition, or manipulate video.

The bows give a detailed measure of every aspect of your playing. The bow contains a variety of sensors to capture your performance including a 3d accelerometer, hair tension sensor, grip pressure sensor, bow length and bow to fingerboard sensors.

By enabling the string quartet to access the unlimited sound world of the computer, the K-Bow advances western art music to places never before possible, and allows the interpretation of electronic scores by multiple ensembles.

Complete with integrated software, the K-Bow applications feature sophisticated DSP processing that allow performers to process their sound, recording multitrack loops, control surround panning, and communicate with other software; all from their familiar instrument.
