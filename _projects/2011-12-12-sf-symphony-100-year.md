[Obscura Digital](http://www.obscuradigital.com) completed the architectural projections for the San Francisco Symphony&#8217;s 100 Year Anniversary Gala, &#8220;Fanfare for a New Century&#8221;. Over 2,700 attendees came to see our augmentation of the interior of Davies Symphony Hall with a architecturally aligned video canvas.

The bill for this &#8217;11-&#8217;12 season opener included Copland’s 1938 _Billy the Kid_ Ballet Suite, Lang Lang on the piano for _Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1_ in E-flat major, Itzhak Perlman’s performance of his famed _Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in E minor_ Opus 64, Britten’s _The Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra_ Opus 34. 

Obscura visuals lined the walls during the pre-performance audience seating and intermission. But the real spectacle of the night was our accompaniment to the encore of John Adams&#8217; _Short Ride on a Fast Machine_. This piece consisted of a fly-through of San Francisco starting from satellite views down to a tour of its most famous landmarks. Shots of driving across the Golden Gate and Bay bridges, and of abstract driving scenes, were timed along with the orchestral performance, creating a stunning tribute to the orchestra and composer to whom they have been so closely linked.
