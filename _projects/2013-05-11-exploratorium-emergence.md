For the grand opening celebration of the Exploratorium’s new location in San Francisco, acclaimed creative technology innovators, Obscura Digital, transform the façade of the historic Pier 15 into a luminous portal revealing unseen dimensions of complex micro and macro phenomena.

_**Emergence**_ takes people on a dynamic visual journey, evoking a sense of wonder about the nature of order in our universe. To capture these marvels of nature, Obscura designed and fabricated a series of miniature replicas of the Exploratorium’s façade to contain unique experiments involving fluid dynamics, wax liquefaction, particle interactions, microorganisms, living systems, crystallization, and growth in time lapse.

Documented in ultra high definition video, non-computer generated real-life visualizations of compelling natural subjects are projection mapped back on the surface of the building, creating the illusion of being contained within its structure.

Unique, non-digital sounds, arranged and composed by Obscura musicians, converge with their architectural projections to form extraordinary harmonics, elevating the experience to a new level.
