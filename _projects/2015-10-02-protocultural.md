Protocultural is a series of events to support the encounter of archaeological exploration of art with recent digital practices. It gathers scientists, artists and geeks to develop new forms of artistic and technological expressions based on historical art materials.

Protocultural is a moving space to prototype a continuation of thousands of years of human history expressed in all existing art forms.

Protocultural considers computer coding as a continuation of human writing history. It takes advantage of all intellectual technologies to push forward the borders of emotions, literacy and understanding of life.

Protocultural is an attempt to span art, science, and technology with brains, bare hands and the help of some technology.
