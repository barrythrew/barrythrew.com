Most of the time we think of listening as a static act. Yet changing positions can greatly affect our perceptions of sound and space. A room’s architecture and its resonances can create radically different listening experiences in different places. And many of the principles of hearing that help us locate objects or navigate a space also influence how we hear music.

Specifically designed for the Kanbar Forum’s Meyer Sound Constellation acoustic system, Frequent Sea is a dynamic composition that visitors perceptually co-create by walking through the space and standing in various locations. As steady, pure tones are gradually introduced at different points around the room, increasingly complex polyrhythms and melodies emerge from the physical collision of sound waves in both space and ears, providing each listener with a singular, embodied experience.
