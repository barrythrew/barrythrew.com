Experimental gowns, headpieces, and jewelry by avant-garde fashion designers such as Alexander McQueen, Gucci, and Iris van Herpen investigate symbols of womanhood and expand the theme of fashion as art. More than 100 articles of daring fashion are presented in a dramatic gallery design that explores seven archetypal personality types, including Sage, Magician, Enchantress, Explorer, Mother Earth, Heroine, and Thespian.

A Queen Within: Adorned Archetypes is an exhibition developed by Barrett Barrera Projects and MUSEEA.

  A Queen Within was left orphaned upon transition from its previous touring company. I consulted to handle deinstallation and touring logistics for this exhibition's exit from NOMA and return to its base in St. Louis. With Fabricatorz, we worked to create a new touring company to handle subsueqent international touring for A Queen Within, Projects+Exhibitions, which was later dissolved.
