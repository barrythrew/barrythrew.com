On Saturday, September 20, 2014, the United Nations Department of Public Information presented a spectacular 30-story architectural projection in partnership with the Oceanic Preservation Society, Obscura Digital, and Insurgent Media. The General Assembly and Secretariat buildings were lit up with massive projections as part of a revolutionary call for action on global climate change.

The event took place in connection with the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Summit. “Now is the time to take decisive action on climate change. Protecting our planet is the responsibility of each and every one of us. We must make our voices heard. These exceptional projections shown at the United Nations will help draw attention to the need to make climate action a reality in every community and every society,” said UN Secretary-General General Ban Ki-moon.

The visual showcase was made possible with the support of TheDodo.com and the Lehrer Family Foundation and produced in conjunction with Okeanos – Foundation for the Sea, Vulcan Productions, and Millennium ART. illUmiNations was a collaborative effort between Academy Award-winning director Louie Psihoyos, Academy Award-winning producer Fisher Stevens, and Obscura Digital. The musical score for the video was composed by Academy Award-nominated composer J. Ralph.
